## Exercise 04

Graduation and Final Exercise, the following is extracted from the `Enhanced Mars Rover Kata` a classical in the space of `FP-oriented` katas.

The difficulty level of this exercise is considered to be advanced and it will show fundamentally every aspect that usually appear in the design and implementation of a program using functional programming techniques.

There are many solutions in different languages and many different solutions even within a single language, none of the publicly available solutions are in TypeScript but it is a very nice exercise to take a look at the variants to get a feeling of the concepts of FP that can be carried across language boundaries.

## Description
Youâ€™re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of the planet.
Implement an application that simulates the movement of a rover on a planet with data provided by user.

NOTE: for each version try to first model all functions signatures (use `declare`) and then implement them.
The idea is to get a quick and cheap responsibility distribution phase.

## V1 - Focus on the center (pure domain logic and types)

Develop an API that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are executed by the rover.

- The planet is divided into a grid with x (width) and y (height) size.
- The rover has a position expressed as x, y co-ordinates and an orientation (North, Est, West, South).
- The rover can handle four commands: turn left or right, move forward or backward.
- Commands are sent in batch (like an array)
- Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another (pacman effect).

## V2 - Focus on boundaries (from primitive types to domain types and viceversa)

Our domain is composed by rich types but input/output data must be privitive

- Write a parser for the planet (grid) size: "5x4"
- Write a rover initial state parser: "1,3:W"
- Write an rendering as string: "positionX:positionY:direction"

## V3 - More domain logic (partial function in domain logic)

We discover that there are obstacles on the planet.

- domain logic:
  - An obstacle has a position expressed as x, y co-ordinates.
  - There are many obstacles.
  - Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new position.
  - If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and aborts the sequence.
- boundaries:
  - Write a parser for a list of obstacles: "1,2 0,0 3,4"
  - Update rendering, show hit obstacle info: "O:positionX:positionY:direction"

## V4 - Focus on I/O (compose pure IO values)

- Build initial state and execute all commands:
  - Read planet.txt from file (size and obstacles)
  - Read rover.txt from file (position and direction)
  - Read commands from console (ask to the user)
- After commands execution:
  - Print final output to the console (happy and not happy paths)
  - Handle, in a safe way, any unhandled exception and log them
