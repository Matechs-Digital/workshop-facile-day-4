## Exercise 03

Keeping state through computation, discuss alternatives.

## State Data-Type

In pretty much the same way as we did `Reader` we could define:

```ts
interface State<S, A> {
  (s: S): readonly [S, A];
}
```

and then define stacks of the form:

```ts
type StateReaderTaskEither<S, R, E, A> = (s: S) => ReaderTaskEither<R, E, readonly [S, A]>>
```

This approach while being completely correct and fully immutable in principle usually lead to a lot of boilerplate primarily due to the fact that TypeScript doesn't have automatic typeclass derivation like other FP languages have.

## Mutable Ref

An alternative approach inspired by scala's ZIO and by the RIO architecture in haskell is to embed the State in a mutable reference as a service used in the `Reader`'s context

This approach turns out to be very nice to use in combination with contravariant readers like we did in the previous workshops.

We can create a new module with a generic interface like the following:

```ts
export interface StateRef<S> {
  readonly get: UIO<S>;
  readonly set: (s: S) => UIO<S>;
  readonly update: (f: (s: S) => S) => UIO<S>;
  readonly modify: <A>(f: (s: S) => readonly [S, A]) => UIO<A>;
}
```

And implement `makeStateRef(s: S)` as a function that returns an `App` that when invoked will first create a mutable reference to the state, initially set as `s: S` that created a `StateRef<S>`.

```ts
export declare function makeStateRef<S>(s: S): UIO<StateRef<S>>;
```

## Usage

Let's now implement a service that keeps a simple counter state and exposes a set of functionalities to increase/decrease/read the current count.

```ts
export interface Counter {
  Counter: {
    get: UIO<number>;
    increment: UIO<number>;
    decrement: UIO<number>;
  };
}

// using provideM & makeStateRef
export declare const provideCounter: <R, E, A>(
  fa: App<R & Counter, E, A>
) => App<R, E, A>;

// using accessM
export declare const get: App<Counter, never, number>;
export declare const increment: App<Counter, never, number>;
export declare const decrement: App<Counter, never, number>;
```

## Final

Write a program that use the counter to do a set of increments/decrements and emits the final result
